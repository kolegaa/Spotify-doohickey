# What is this?
A little webapp to display the currently played song on spotify as an image

# Why?
I wanted to put it on my spacehey profile

# How do I use it? 
(works locally but not yet in deployment)

when you open it there should be a login button, once you log in you should be redirected 
(you can also go to to the /nowplaying route with the same arguments to see the site in html instead of an image)

# How?
spotify api, puppeteer, html2canvas and like 4 different http request libraries

# Can i use your code?
Sure, go for it, it's not very good though.
